# Advanced SQL Injection in Modern Applications

SQL injection remains one of the most critical vulnerabilities in web applications, despite being well-documented for over two decades. In this post, we'll explore advanced SQL injection techniques that are still effective against modern applications.

## Understanding the Basics

Before diving into advanced techniques, let's review the fundamentals:

1. SQL injection occurs when user input is improperly sanitized
2. Attackers can manipulate SQL queries to access unauthorized data
3. Modern frameworks provide protection, but misconfigurations are common

## Advanced Techniques

### Blind SQL Injection

When applications don't return database errors, we can use blind techniques:

```sql
' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(username,1,1) FROM users WHERE id=1)='a'--
```

### Time-Based Attacks

Using database-specific functions to create delays:

```sql
'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'--
```

## Prevention Strategies

1. Use parameterized queries
2. Implement proper input validation
3. Apply the principle of least privilege
4. Regular security testing

## Conclusion

While SQL injection is an old vulnerability, it continues to plague modern applications. Understanding these techniques helps both attackers and defenders stay ahead of the curve.
